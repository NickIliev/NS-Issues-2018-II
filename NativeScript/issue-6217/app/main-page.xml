    The StackLayout stacks UI components on the screenâ€”either vertically or horizontally.
    In this case, the StackLayout does vertical stacking; you can change the stacking to
    horizontal by applying a orientation="horizontal" attribute to the <StackLayout> element.
    You can learn more about NativeScript layouts at
    https://docs.nativescript.org/ui/layout-containers.

    These components make use of several CSS class names that are part of the NativeScript
    core theme, such as p-20, btn, h2, and text-center. You can view a full list of the
    class names available for styling your app at https://docs.nativescript.org/ui/theme.

        <Label text="Tap the button" class="h1 text-center"/>
        <Button text="TAP" tap="tap" class="btn btn-primary btn-active"/>
    </StackLayout>
